input from [[pm simple run]] system

The adaptive sampling protocol works by running multiple batches of simulations (called epochs) in a sequential manner. At the end of each epoch, an analysis of the system is performed and it intelligently decides from which already-explored conformations to start new simulations from in the next epoch to reach the desired goal (binding/unbinding).
