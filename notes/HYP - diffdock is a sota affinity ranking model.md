## hypothesis
[[diffdock]] can be used to rank [[small molecule]] ligands by their affinity, in what is called an [[affinity ranking]] problem. Given that diffdock is using both the protein and the small molecule, without prior knowledge, we can concretise the taska as a: 

[[zero shot learning]] - [[combined affinity ranking]] of small molecule binding

## claim
* [[CLM - diffdock is a sota blind docking model]]
* [[CLM - combined affinity ranking leads to better results than ligand based affinity ranking]] 

## experiment
* [[does diffdock lead to sota performance on the D3R GC4 BACE 1a problem?]]
