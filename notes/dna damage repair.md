## relevant genes
[[CDKN1A]] aka [[p21]]
[[CDKN2A]] aka [[p16]] 
[[SQSTM1]] aka [[p62]] or sequestome 1

[[TP53]] as the kingpin of deciding about further strategy

## [[epigenetics]] response
1. [[ATM]] for detection
2. [[SIRT]] and [[HDAC]] recruited within seconds
3. [[NBS1]] and [[MRE11]]

## [[DNA damage response]]
* [[dna damage repair]]
* [[apoptosis]]
* [[senescence]]

## 
[[DNA damage]] is potentiated by [[proliferation]]
the combined triggering of [[DNA damage]] and [[proliferation]] is a double whammy during [[inflammation]]
