## characteristics
* size < 1kDa

## three concepts of reasoning
* [[pharmacokinetics]] - how the candidate is distributed
* [[pharmacodynamics]] - how the candidate engages with its target
* [[toxicology]] - how the candidate engages with its target and other targets in ways that lead to detrimental health events

## representations
* classic representations
	*  [[SMILES]]
	* [[SELFIES]]
* learned representations via [[small molecule representation learning]]
	* [[graph neural networks]] 
		* [[UniMol]]

## related concepts
[[natural products]]
[[semi synthetic compounds]]

## notes
a [[small molecules]] is basically just an exogenous [[metabolites]]
